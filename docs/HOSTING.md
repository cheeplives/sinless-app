# Hosting Sinless with logins + cloud character storage

This turns the static app into a multi-user app: players sign in with Google or
GitHub, new accounts wait in an **admin-approval queue**, and each approved user's
characters sync to the server and follow them across devices. The rules engine
still runs in the browser — the server only stores per-user character JSON.

**If you don't do any of this, nothing changes:** with no `/api` backend present
(e.g. GitHub Pages), the app detects that and runs exactly as before — local
`localStorage` only, no login screen.

## Requirements

- Shared hosting (or any server) with **PHP 7.4+** (8.x fine) and the `pdo_mysql`
  + `curl` extensions (both are standard).
- A **MySQL** database.
- **HTTPS** on your domain (required for OAuth + secure cookies; most hosts
  include free Let's Encrypt).
- The app served from the domain root (or a subpath) with `/api/*.php` reachable
  at the same origin.

## 1. Create the database tables

Import `db/schema.sql` into your database (phpMyAdmin → SQL tab, or CLI):

```
mysql -u <dbuser> -p <dbname> < db/schema.sql
```

## 2. Register the OAuth apps

You need at least one provider. The **Authorization callback URL** for both is:

```
https://YOURDOMAIN/api/auth/callback.php
```

**Google** — [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) →
*APIs & Services → Credentials → Create OAuth client ID → Web application*.
Add the callback above as an *Authorized redirect URI*. Configure the OAuth
consent screen (External, add yourself as a test user while unverified). Copy the
**Client ID** and **Client secret**.

**GitHub** — *Settings → Developer settings → OAuth Apps → New OAuth App*.
Set *Authorization callback URL* to the callback above. Copy the **Client ID**
and generate a **Client secret**.

## 3. Configure the server

```
cp api/config.example.php api/config.php
```

Edit `api/config.php`:
- `db` — your MySQL host/name/user/password.
- `base_url` — `https://YOURDOMAIN` (no trailing slash). Used to build the OAuth
  redirect and to keep post-login redirects same-origin.
- `oauth.google` / `oauth.github` — the client id + secret from step 2. Leave a
  provider's `client_id` blank to hide its button.
- `admin_identities` — **add your own** email or `provider:id` here so your first
  sign-in is auto-approved and made admin (that's how you approve everyone else).
- `approval_webhook_url` — a Discord/Slack *incoming webhook* URL (step 5).
- `session.cookie_secure` — leave `true` (HTTPS). `session.save_path` can stay
  blank: the app now keeps session files in its own private directory (below).

### Session files live in their own directory

Leave `session.save_path` blank and `boot_session()` puts session files in
`<parent of web root>/.sinless-sessions/<session name>`, creating it `0700`. On
shared hosting the parent of the web root is your account home, so the directory
is outside the web root and owned by you. On DreamHost with the site at
`/home/USER/YOURDOMAIN`, that resolves to
`/home/USER/.sinless-sessions/sinless_sid`.

Set an absolute path in config to override. Either way, if the directory can't
be created or written the app **falls back to PHP's default rather than breaking
every login**, and logs the reason when the path was set explicitly.

Two things follow from owning the directory:

- Nothing else sweeps it. That's the point — the shared default is cleaned on a
  schedule you don't control, and a cron sweep ignores `gc_maxlifetime`.
- PHP's own garbage collection becomes the only cleanup, so `boot_session()`
  raises `session.gc_probability` when the host has it at `0` (which is exactly
  what cron-sweeping distros ship). Without that, files would accumulate forever.

> **If users report having to re-login every day**, it's almost always one of
> these two, not OAuth:
> - The session cookie is only kept until the browser closes. That's
>   `session.cookie_lifetime => 0`; omit the key to follow `idle_timeout`
>   instead.
> - PHP garbage-collected the session **file** early. `boot_session()` raises
>   `session.gc_maxlifetime` to the idle window, but on hosts where GC runs from
>   cron rather than from PHP that ini is ignored and the system sweep wins — and
>   on shared hosting another tenant's sweep can delete your files too. The
>   private `save_path` above is what actually fixes this; confirm it resolved by
>   checking that `.sinless-sessions/` exists and is filling with `sess_*` files.

**Keep `config.php` secret.** The bundled `.htaccess` denies web access to it and
`.gitignore` keeps it out of git. Best of all: move it above the web root and
adjust the `require` path at the top of `api/lib.php`.

## 4. Upload the files

Deploy the whole repo to your web root so that `index.html` is at the site root
and `api/`, `static/`, `db/` sit alongside it. Confirm PHP runs (visiting
`https://YOURDOMAIN/api/auth/me.php` should return JSON like
`{"error":"not_authenticated","providers":[...]}`, **not** the PHP source).

The included `.htaccess` forces HTTPS and sets security headers
(HSTS, CSP, nosniff, frame-deny). It needs Apache with `mod_rewrite` + `mod_headers`
(standard on shared hosting). On nginx, replicate those headers + the HTTPS
redirect in your server config, and ensure `config.php` isn't served.

## 5. Signup notifications (Discord/Slack webhook)

- **Discord:** Server Settings → Integrations → Webhooks → New Webhook → copy URL.
- **Slack:** create an Incoming Webhook app → copy URL.

Paste it into `approval_webhook_url`. When a new person signs in and lands in the
pending queue, the server posts a short alert there (fire-and-forget — a slow or
failed webhook never blocks login).

### Account status email (optional)

To email a user when you **approve** or **revoke** them, fill in the
`approval_email` block in the config (`enabled => true` plus a `from` address; a
single switch covers both events). For deliverability the `from` **must** be an
address on a domain your host is authorized to send for — e.g.
`Sinless <noreply@yourdomain.com>`, not a gmail.com address — so SPF/DKIM align
and it doesn't get spam-filtered. It uses PHP `mail()` and is fire-and-forget: a
mail failure never blocks the admin action, and only an actual status change
sends (re-approving/re-revoking doesn't re-send; admins are never emailed on
revoke). The approval message's sign-in link uses `base_url`.

Not receiving them? Run the CLI diagnostic from the site directory:
`php api/tools/mail-test.php you@example.com`. It prints which config file was
actually loaded (a common gotcha: editing `api/config.php` when the live config
is `~/sinless-config.php`), whether the block is switched on, and whether
`mail()` accepted the message — separating config problems from delivery
(SPF/DKIM/spam) problems.

## 6. First run

1. Visit the site → login gate → sign in with the account you listed in
   `admin_identities`. You're auto-approved as **admin**.
2. When a friend signs in, they see an **Awaiting approval** screen and you get a
   webhook ping. Open **Admin** (rail or sheet menu) → **Approve**. Their screen
   unlocks automatically (it polls every 30s).
3. Approved users' characters now save to the server and sync across devices.

## Local development

You can run the whole thing locally with PHP's built-in server + a local MySQL:

```
php -S localhost:8000 -t .
```

Register throwaway OAuth apps whose callback is
`http://localhost:8000/api/auth/callback.php`, set `base_url` to
`http://localhost:8000`, and set `session.cookie_secure` to `false` (http). Then
run through the verification checklist in the plan.

## Security notes (already built in)

- All character queries are scoped to the session user (no cross-account access
  by guessing a slug).
- OAuth uses a one-time `state`, TLS-verified token exchange, and **requires a
  verified email**; provider access tokens are never stored.
- Sessions: id regenerated on login, strict mode, Secure/HttpOnly/SameSite=Lax,
  idle + absolute timeouts.
- Mutations require a CSRF token; request bodies are size-capped; the `slug` is
  re-validated server-side.
- Signing out wipes that account's cached characters from the browser (safe on
  shared computers).

## Notes / limits

- **Conflicts** are last-write-wins by edit time — editing the same character on
  two devices at once can lose the older edit. Fine for normal play.
- **Existing local characters** (made before you signed in) stay in the browser's
  local namespace; sign-in starts a fresh per-account cache. Use **Export/Import
  JSON** to move an old local character into your account.
